Web Brogue
==========

A web[sockets] server for playing the Brogue over the internet.  Brogue is a game for Mac OS X, Windows, and Linux by Brian Walker.  For more information go https://sites.google.com/site/broguegame/.  The server only can be run on a POSIX environment at the moment.

Build Instructions
-----------------------

### Step 1: Get Dependencies ###
Get the latest stable version of node.js and mongoDB. (Or whatever mongoDB comes with your distro which should be fine.)

### Step 2: Get node packages
Navigate to the `server` directory and run `npm install` to get the node dependencies. You'll need a C++ compiler to compile the datagrams module.

### Step 3: Build Brogue Executables ##
The paths to the binaries is stored in `server/config.js`.
Brogue binaries are stored in the `binaries/` directory. Linux ELF binaries are included in the distribution for all supported brogue versions. If there's a new version of a brogue variant, or a replay-breaking change is added to a brogue version without changing the version, create a new variant and add a new brogue binary. This allows old recordings to still work. (Note that a new variant means separate high scores for now.)

The lineage of each brogue version and build instructions is given below. You shouldn't need to follow these unless you're building for a different platform.

* Brogue (1.7.4): `cd brogue` `make web`
* Brogue (1.7.5): `cd brogue-1.7.5` `make web`
* gBrogue: `cd gbrogue` `make -f Makefile.linux web`
* unBrogue: `cd unBrogue` `make web`
* broguePlus: `cd brogueplus` `make web`
* Brogue CE (1.8): Clone `https://github.com/flend/BrogueCE` and checkout branch `tracking/web-brogue`. `make bin/brogue` then copy binary to `binaries/brogue-ce18`
* Brogue CE (1.9): Clone `https://github.com/flend/BrogueCE` and checkout branch `tracking/web-brogue-v193`. `make bin/brogue` then copy binary to `binaries/brogue-ce19-c813284` (or similar filename)
* Brogue CE (1.10): Clone `https://github.com/flend/BrogueCE` and checkout branch `tracking/web-brogue-v110`. `make bin/brogue` then copy binary to `binaries/brogue-ce110` (or similar filename)
* Brogue CE (1.11+): Clone `https://github.com/flend/BrogueCE` and checkout branch `tracking/web-brogue-v1XX`. `make bin/brogue` then copy binary to `binaries/brogue-ce111` (or similar filename). This binary also includes RapidBrogue from v1.5+
* Rapid Brogue (v1.4 and earlier): Clone `https://github.com/flend/rapidbrogue` and checkout branch `tracking/rapid-brogue-vXXX`. `make bin/brogue` then copy binary to `binaries/rapid-brogue-vXXX` (or similar filename)

Starting the Server
----------------------------

Starting the server should be as simple as starting up mongoDB and starting the node process.

1. To start the mongodb daemon type `mongod` (this should be started at system init in most cases)
2. To start the server type `npm start` in the `server` directory.

You will probably want to edit `server/config.js` and `client/config.js` to set the ports and the server secret.

If everything is running correctly it should say "Server listening on port XXXX"

Note that you might need root access if you are running on a privileged port (e.g. 80).

Configuration
--------------------------------
Server global configuration variables are defined in `server/config.js`.
Client configuration variables are defined in `client/config.js`.

In particular, make sure to get the client and server to agree on the websocketPort.

Restarting the server
--------------------------------
When you restart (kill and run again) the server to start running a new version, games in progress are not affected.
However, the server will forget about its registry of games that it uses to kill inactive games from over 2 weeks ago.
Therefore you probably want to kill old games.
A good command is `killall --older-than 1M -r ".*brogue.*"` which kills all brogue process started more than 1 month ago.

Tests
----------------------------
An API test suite can be run using `npm test` in the `server` directory.
